Remake of PC classic Burntime

After building once (tested with Visual Studio 2013 Community), place original Burntime files into bin/burntime/game/Burntime 
So that the original BURN.EXE has the path game/Burntime/BURN.EXE

Without the original Burntime files the game won't start.

For more infos take a look at the original home at https://code.google.com/p/burntimedeluxe/
There are also binaries to download.
