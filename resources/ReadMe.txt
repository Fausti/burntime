1. Installation
----------------

Music installation:

Start Launcher.exe, go to the "More" tab and you will find a 
"Burntime Classic Music" package. After download you may have to 
enable music in the options you find in the "Classic" tab.

New graphics installation:

Start Launcher.exe, go to the "More" tab and you will find a 
"Burntime Classic NewGfx" package. After download you may have to 
enable new graphics in the options you find in the "Classic" tab.

Note: You have to enable online features in the options of "More".


2. Classic
-----------

Burntime Classic is meant to be as close as possible to the original.

With some exceptions:
 * New balancing of difficulty and item placement
 * Totally different AI
 * Path finding is improved
 * Some new items
 * Very few UI changes (e.g. putting a bottle in a room with a source
   will fill it immediately)

If you find anything else that is different to the original, please 
tell me.


3. New graphics
----------------

It is possible to enable only new fonts with old graphics. To do so 
no NewGfx package is required.

Any other graphics are distributed with the NewGfx package and are 
work in progress.
